<h1>DISCRETIZATION OF CONTINUOUS DATASETS</h1>

The task of extracting knowledge from databases is quite often performed by machine learning algorithms. Many algorithms can only process discrete attributes. Real-world databases often involve continuous features. Those features have to be discretized before using such algorithms. Discretization methods can transform continuous features into a finite number of intervals, where each interval is associated with a numerical discrete value. This paper analyzed existing data discretization techniques for data preprocessing. Firstly, the importance and process of discretization is studied. Furthermore, we conduct an experimental study of discretization methods involving the most representative and newest discretizers. It's essential to select proper methods depending on the learning environment. At last, the thought of choosing the best discretization methods in association analysis is proposed as future research.
